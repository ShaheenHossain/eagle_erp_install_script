# [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com "Odoo's Homepage") Install Script

This script is based on the install script from Andr√© Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts)
but goes a bit further and has been improved. This script will also give you the ability to define an xmlrpc_port in the .conf file that is generated under /etc/
This script can be safely used in a multi-odoo code base server because the default Odoo port is changed BEFORE the Odoo is started.

## Installation procedure

##### 1. Download the script:
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShaheenHossain/installScript_01/niirwebsys1230/eagle-install-1230.sh

```
sudo chmod +x eagle-install-1230.sh
```

```
sudo ./eagle-install-1230.sh
```
