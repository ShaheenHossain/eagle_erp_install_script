This script is based on the install script from Andr√© Schenkels (https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts)
but goes a bit further. This script will also give you the ability to define an xmlrpc_port in the .conf file that is generated under /etc/
This script can be safely used in a multi-eagle erp code base server because the default eagle erp port is changed BEFORE the eagle erp is started.

<h3>What version to choose?</h3>
By chosing the version at the top in Github you can choose to use the script according to your need.
8.0 is specifically build for eagle erp installations
9.0 is specifically build for eagle erp installations
master is specifically build for testing & development
